# Pokémon List Web Application

## Project Description

This project is a simple web application that displays a list of Pokémon, allowing users to browse, search, and view detailed information about each Pokémon. It's designed to be user-friendly and offers a rich interface to engage Pokémon enthusiasts.

### Reflection on the Work

- **Role and Tasks**: As the sole developer,  I was responsible for designing the architecture, implementing the core functionality, and styling the user interface. I faced challenges such as integrating the Pokémon API and creating a responsive layout.

- **Decisions and Consequences**: I chose to use Bootstrap for the styling to speed up the development process. This decision led to a consistent design but limited some customization options. I also decided to use vanilla JavaScript instead of a framework like React, making the application lightweight but requiring more manual management of the DOM.

- **What Would Be Done Differently**: If given the opportunity, I might choose a modern front-end framework like React for more efficient state management and component reusability. Additionally, I'd invest more time in user experience (UX) design to enhance user interaction.

- **Lessons Learned**: This project taught me the importance of planning, the effectiveness of modular coding, and the value of user feedback. Balancing design and functionality was a continuous learning experience..

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the content.
- **CSS & Bootstrap**: Styled the application.
- **JavaScript & jQuery**: Managed interactivity.

### Other Relevant Materials

- **User Flows & User Stories**: Created user flows and stories to guide the development of the navigation and interaction design, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Kanban Board**: Utilized a Kanban board for task management, enabling smooth collaboration with other team members and efficient tracking of project progress.
